					<p>
						Aoraki/ Mt. Cook National Park, located in the south island of New Zealand, is one of the most popular outdoor tourist destinations in the country. A magnificent national park that showcases some of the best walks in New Zealand. 
						These beautiful walks range from short and beginner level to multi-day advanced walks. 
						Come and visit Aoraki/ Mt. Cook National Park for the adventure of a lifetime. 
						Aoraki/ Mt. Cook National Park is a 1-hour drive from Tekapo and is a premier destination for outdoor enthusiasts and mountaineers.
						<br>
					</p>

					<h3>The Legend of Aoraki/ Mt. Cook</h3>
					<p>
						
						The maori name Aoraki comes from the maori legend of Maui and his four brothers who came from heaven. They sailed the seas in their waka (canoes) until Maui decided to cast a 
						fishing hook that was made from his ancestor’s jawbone, then caught a fish, Te Ika-a Maui, which was so large that it eventually became the north island of New Zealand. 
						Maui then left to find a priest and his 4 brothers, Aoraki, Rakiro, Rakirua and Rarakiroa took a share of the big fish and carried on their journey on their canoes. 
						Due to a big storm, their canoe flipped over, and the brothers climbed onto the flipped waka, but they unfortunately were frozen into stone and now make up New Zealand’s South Island. 
						The brothers are believed to make up the mountains of the southern alps of New Zealand, with Aoraki, the eldest, being the highest mountain peak in the country. Rakiro is believed to be Mount Dampier, 
						Rarakiro to be Mount Tasman and Rakirua as Mount Teichelman. 
						<br><br>
						The Ngai Tahu tribe hold this legend as an important cultural and spiritual tale of their ancestors until this day. As a result, Aoraki/ Mt. Cook National Park is protected and conserved since it is considered as sacred land by the Maori people. 
					</p>

					<h3>History of Aoraki/Mt. Cook</h3>
					<p>
						In the 17th century, the famed explorer Abel Tasman and his crew were believed to have seen the mountains of Aoraki from the west coast. In 1769, it was Captain James Cook who was first to travel around the islands of New Zealand, 
						but it was in 1851 that Captain John Lort Stokes named Aoraki in honor of Captain James Cook. 
						<br><br>
						While the Ngai Tahu believed that climbing Aoraki to be disrespectful to their ancestors since it was believed to be the physical head and manifestation of their sacred ancestor, European travellers and settlers were intent on conquering the various peaks within the area. 
						The first attempt was in 1882, by an Irishman, Reverend Green, along with 2 Swiss guides. However, they only reached 20 meters below the actual summit of Aoraki/ Mt. Cook and it was only 12 years later in 1894, that 3 Kiwis (New Zealanders), Tom Fyfe, Jack Clarke and George Graham,  fittingly reached the summit. 
						<br><br>
						Sir Edmun Hillary, arguably the most famous mountaineer and first to climb Mt. Everest, climbed his first major mountain at Aoraki. It was here where he trained for his legendary climb of Mt. Everest. A tribute to the great man was established within the National Park, aptly named the Sir Edmund Hillary Alpine Centre. 
						At the Hermitage hotel, which was first built in 1884, a commemorative statue of Sir Edmund Hillary was unveiled in 2003 to honour his achievements with him being present at the time. A museum is currently in the Hermitage hotel to honour the history of the early settlers and pioneers of mountaineering.

					<h3>Hiking Trails</h3>
					
					<p>
						We fast forward to present day and Aoraki/ Mt. Cook National Park is one of the premier destinations that New Zealand has to offer. With luxurious suites and breath-taking views, travellers who choose to relax will not be disappointed. While most of us will never be able to reach the heights, literally and figuratively, 
						that Sir Edmund Hillary reached, there are still walking trails that cater to beginner and advanced hikers. We will feature 2 of the easier tracks within the park, which are the Hooker Valley Track and the Tasman Glacier Track.
						<br>
					</p>
					<h4>Tasman Glacier Track</h4>

					<p>
						The Tasman Glacier track is an easy and flat, 2.5km out and back walk that approximately takes 1 hour. It is recommended for beginners and groups with children or elderly hikers. It is a beautiful and relaxing walk that lets you enjoy the majesty of the southern alps without challenging you too physically. At the end of the walk is a lookout to the Tasman Glacier, which is the longest glacier in New Zealand, which is about 23kms in length. 
						You can enjoy a relaxing picnic and take a few snapshots of this stunning landscape after a short walk. <br><br>
					</p>

					<h4>Hooker Valley Track</h4>
					<img class="glacier" src="photos\Mt. Cook\hooker valley.jpg">
					<p>
						The Hooker Valley Track is the longer and more challenging, albeit still great for beginners, half day walk. It is a 10km return track with 5kms each way. It is estimated to take 3 hours to complete. The track brings you deeper into the park and has a slight increase in elevation throughout the walk. 
						3 amazing swing bridges are also located along the track. However, on days with bad weather, the first swing bridge will be closed to prevent travellers from progressing further onto the track and ensure the safety of all. On clear and sunny days, the beauty of the southern alps will leave you in awe as you progress through the walk. The rivers running through the valley will also have this stunning blue shade from all the “glacier flour” that goes into the water and settles on the bottom. However, the water will be a murky grey when the glacier flour has been stirred up by rain. At the end of the Hooker Valley track is a picnic area beside a beautiful lake. 
						Take the time to enjoy the surroundings as you eat lunch and recuperate before heading back. 
					</p>

					<h5>
						Aoraki/ Mt. Cook National Park has more to discover than the 2 walks that we highlighted in this article. There are multi-day hikes for advanced mountaineers, where you will ascend higher into the mountains and stay at Department of Conservation huts and spend the night in this stunning landscape. We hope that you will tap into your adventurous side, get out of your comfort zone, and explore Aoraki/ Mt. Cook National Park. See you there!
